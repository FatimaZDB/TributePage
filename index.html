    <h2><strong>The origin of the series</strong></h2>
    <P>The series originated from an animated short parody film of the main protagonists of <em>Back to the Future</em>, created by Justin Roiland for Channel 101, a short film festival co-founded by Dan Harmon. In 2013 Roiland and Harmon developed a series based on the characters already created by Roiland.</P>
